***PART 2***

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number. The program then prints "Hunter" the number of times the user entered. Use a while loop.

Example of what should appear when the program runs:

Times to print: 3
Hunter
Hunter
Hunter

'''
n = int(input("Times to Print: "))
m = 0
while m < n :
  m = m+1
  print("Hunter")
